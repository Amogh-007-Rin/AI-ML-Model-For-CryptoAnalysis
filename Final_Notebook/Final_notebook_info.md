# Crypto_Trend_Analysis.ipynb — Final Notebook Overview

**Notebook path:** `Final_Notebook/Crypto_Trend_Analysis.ipynb`  
**Repository:** `AI-ML-Model-For-CryptoAnalysis`

## Summary
`Crypto_Trend_Analysis.ipynb` is a comprehensive, final analysis notebook that combines the work of four team members. It contains dataset overview, data loading and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, preprocessing and pipeline creation, outlier analysis, and model training & evaluation (including baseline models and hyperparameter tuning). The notebook concludes with detailed insights and strategic recommendations based on EDA and model results.

## Team Contributions (combined into this notebook)
- **Amogh Dath Kalasapura Arunkumar** — Model Training and Evaluation  
- **Rajveer Singh Saini** — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Harshpreet Singh** — Dataset Pre-processing  
- **Jaspreet Kaur** — Dataset Overview

This final notebook is the consolidated output of four notebooks authored by the team members above.
